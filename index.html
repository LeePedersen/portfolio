                <p>Hi, my name is Lee! I find writing about myself to be rather difficult, so I'm going to tell you about chickens instead.</p>
                <p>Chickens are wonderful creatures. They're a lot smarter than people give them credit for, and they're very cute. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird, and their total population is almost three times that of humans.</p>
                <p>I grew up around a farm, and there were a lot of chickens there. My sister and I took care of them and basically saw them as pets. My science fair project in eighth grade was an attempt to figure out whether chickens could see color or not. After a very scientific process involving making differently-colored blueberries out of clay, I established that they could indeed see color. Chickens <em>really</em> like blueberries.</p>

                <p>I took an intro to programming class awhile ago, and really liked it. After working as a line cook for awhile, I'm ready to find something different. Coding is fun and stimulates my brain.</p>
